  Abstract                 = {Reliable systems have always been built out of unreliable components [1]. Early on, the reliable components were small such as mirrored disks or ECC (Error Correcting Codes) in core memory. These systems were designed such that failures of these small components were transparent to the application. Later, the size of the unreliable components grew larger and semantic challenges crept into the application when failures occurred.
Fault tolerant algorithms comprise a set of idempotent sub- algorithms. Between these idempotent sub-algorithms, state is sent across the failure boundaries of the unreliable components. The failure of an unreliable component can then be tolerated as a takeover by a backup, which uses the last known state and drives forward with a retry of the idempotent sub-algorithm. Classically, this has been done in a linear fashion (i.e. one step at a time).
As the granularity of the unreliable component grows (from a mirrored disk to a system to a data center), the latency to communicate with a backup becomes unpalatable. This leads to a more relaxed model for fault tolerance. The primary system will acknowledge the work request and its actions without waiting to ensure that the backup is notified of the work. This improves the responsiveness of the system because the user is not delayed behind a slow interaction with the backup.
There are two implications of asynchronous state capture:
1) Everything promised by the primary is probabilistic. There is always a chance that an untimely failure shortly after the promise results in a backup proceeding without knowledge of
the commitment. Hence, nothing is guaranteed!
2) Applications must ensure eventual consistency [20]. Since work may be stuck in the primary after a failure and reappear
later, the processing order for work cannot be guaranteed.
Platform designers are struggling to make this easier for their applications. Emerging patterns of eventual consistency and probabilistic execution may soon yield a way for applications to express requirements for a “looser” form of consistency while providing availability in the face of ever larger failures. As we will also point out in this paper, the patterns of probabilistic execution and eventual consistency are applicable to intermittently connected application patterns.
This paper recounts portions of the evolution of these trends, attempts to show the patterns that span these changes, and talks about future directions as we continue to “build on quicksand”.},

  Abstract                 = {Placing data as close as possible to computation is a common practice of data intensive systems, commonly referred to as the data locality problem. By analyzing existing production systems, we confirm the benefit of data locality and find that data have different popularity and varying correlation of accesses. We propose DARE, a distributed adaptive data replication algorithm that aids the scheduler to achieve better data locality. DARE solves two problems, how many replicas to allocate for each file and where to place them, using probabilistic sampling and a competitive aging algorithm independently at each node. It takes advantage of existing remote data accesses in the system and incurs no extra network usage. Using two mixed workload traces from Face book, we show that DARE improves data locality by more than 7 times with the FIFO scheduler in Hadoop and achieves more than 85% data locality for the FAIR scheduler with delay scheduling. Turnaround time and job slowdown are reduced by 19% and 25\%, respectively.},

We present a new bio-inspired replication management approach which is adaptive, completely decentralized, and based on swarm intelligence. Each node has the autonomy to start at any time, depending on the internal state of its stored data objects, a redistribution process. "Redistribution" means replicate, create, delete, update, or move data objects to other nodes of the network. The redistribution process is a dynamic load-balancing scheme which runs with lower priority in the background.

This problem deviates from the well-known file allocation problem in several aspects. First, the objects to be allocated are not known a priori; second, these objects are accessed by schedules that contain transmissions between objects to produce the result. A model that makes it possible to compare the cost of allocations is presented, the cost can be computed for different cost functions and for processing schedules produced by arbitrary query processing algorithms. For minimizing the total transmission cost, a method is proposed to determine the fragments to be allocated from the relations in the conceptual schema and the queries and updates executed by the users. For the same cost function, the complexity of the data allocation problem is investigated. Methods for obtaining optimal and heuristic solutions under various ways of computing the cost of an allocation are presented and compared. Two different approaches to the allocation management problem are presented and their merits are discussed.}

Some of the areas where the amount of stored data already reach terabytes (TBs) and even petabytess (PBs) are data mining, particle physics, climate modelling, high energy physics and astrophysics, to site few, data which needs to be shared and analysed [12, 15, 16]. DCs are able to ensure that stored data is highly accessible and scalable. But the location of a DC in respect of the client accessing the data has an impact on availability, access times (latency - accessibility) and costs derived from providing the data. Replicating some of the data at multiple sites is a possible solution to reduce some of these undesirable effects, [3, 1, 21]. An increase in the number of replications may result in a large bandwidth savings and lead to a reduction in user response time on reads. But keeping too many replicas of the data incurs in extra costs, such as extra replication traffic to keep all versions of the data coherent (writes), extra required storage and extra computational power [8]...},

  Abstract                 = {Building reliable distributed systems, given the CAP theorem where partitioning must always be considered, relays in the trade-offs between consistency and availability. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) define replicated data types with mathematical properties that ensure absence of conflict and confer them Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC), a form of Eventual Consistency (EC) which it is a technique of compromise. Consistency is a property of the data, not the datastore, given that the rules to decide how to synchronise are business decisions. CRDTs have been created to ensure that we have a computer model for handling data which accommodates data’s nature in a world of vast communication and no definite central place of storage. Using an Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for these type of systems can result in systems where a large amount of the processing is required to circumnavigate the shortcomings of a model that is not fit for purpose. A significant project for mediating this dilemma is SyncFree.
This article provides a brief presentation of the natural language requirements, which shows the special nature of the paradigm shift forcing large-scale distributed applications away from RDBMS.},

  Abstract                 = {Failures of any type are common in current datacenters, partly due to the higher scales of the data stored. As data scales up, its availability becomes more complex, while different availability levels per application or per data item may be required. In this paper, we propose a self-managed key-value store that dynamically allocates the resources of a data cloud to several applications in a cost-efficient and fair way. Our approach offers and dynamically maintains multiple differentiated availability guarantees to each different application despite failures. We employ a virtual economy, where each data partition (i.e. a key range in a consistent-hashing space) acts as an individual optimizer and chooses whether to migrate, replicate or remove itself based on net benefit maximization regarding the utility offered by the partition and its storage and maintenance cost. As proved by a game-theoretical model, no migrations or replications occur in the system at equilibrium, which is soon reached when the query load and the used storage are stable. Moreover, by means of extensive simulation experiments, we have proved that our approach dynamically finds the optimal resource allocation that balances the query processing overhead and satisfies the availability objectives in a cost-efficient way for different query rates and storage requirements. Finally, we have implemented a fully working prototype of our approach that clearly demonstrates its applicability in real settings.},

Such systems are typically used to implement distributed data structures over large scale networks. We introduce a formal definition of eventual consistency that applies to a wide class of existing implementations, including the ones using speculative executions. Then, we reduce the problem of checking eventual consistency to reachability and model checking problems. This reduction enables the use of existing verification tools for message-passing programs in the context of verifying optimistic replication systems. Furthermore, we derive from these reductions decision procedures for checking eventual consistency of systems implemented as finite-state programs communicating through unbounded unordered channels.},

  Abstract                 = {Current mobile and web applications replicate data increasingly at the client-side to reduce latency and to tolerate network issues. Mobile devices have however limited storage and network capabilities. Thus large data structures at the server-side need to be split before being sent to the client and reintegrated when modified, in order to keep a low memory and network usage. Ad-hoc solutions tend to be poorly integrated with server-side storage, and do not have well-defined consistency guarantees.
We propose a replication mechanism built upon conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) to seamlessly replicate parts of large data structures. We define partial replication and give an approach to keep the strong eventual consistency properties of CRDTs with par- tial replicas. We integrate our mechanism into SwiftCloud, a transactional system that brings geo-replication to the client. We evaluate the solution with a content-sharing ap- plication. Our results show improvements in bandwidth, memory, and latency usage over both classical geo-replication and the existing SwiftCloud solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Designers of large user-oriented distributed applications, such as social networks and mobile applications, have adopted measures to improve the responsiveness of their applications. Latency is a major concern as people are very sensitive to it. Geo-replication is a commonly used mechanism to bring the data closer to the clients. Nevertheless, reaching the closest datacenter can still be consid- erably slow. Thus, in order to further reduce the access latency, mobile and web applications may be forced to replicate data at the client-side. Nevertheless, fully replicating large data structures may still be a waste of resources, specially for thin-clients.
We propose a replication mechanism built upon conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) to seamlessly replicate parts of large data structures. We define partial replication and give an approach to keep the strong eventual consistency properties of CRDTs with partial replicas.

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive content networking is a promising new approach aimed at scalable delivery of content to a pervasive client population. By adaptive content delivery networks (A-CDN) content is adapted, replicated and delivered to the clients in a cost-quality-optimized fashion. The integration of content adaptation into CDNs minimizes the interference of adaptation with replication effectiveness.The paper presents ongoing research on replica placement in A-CDNs. Based on a static model for cost-quality-optimized adaptive content networking, algorithms to optimize the placement of replicas in the surrogates of an A-CDN are discussed. The dynamics of a real Web scenario are not explicitly taken into account by the algorithms. Whereas long-term dynamics are dealt with by periodic adjustments of the underlying model and recalculation of an optimal placement, short term dynamics are considered to result in inaccuracies in the system and load model. Therefore, algorithms being tolerant to an imperfect underlying model are chosen.As adaptation path composition turns out to be a subproblem of replica placement in A-CDNs, we also introduce an algorithm for optimal adaptation path composition.},

  Abstract                 = {Replication of state is the fundamental approach to achieve scalability and availability. In order to maintain or restore replica consistency under updates, some form of synchronization is needed. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) ensure eventual consistency, such that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a correct sequential execution without foreground synchronization. A particular CRDT is the set data type, which is a pervasive abstraction for storing collections of unique elements and constitutes an important building block for other, more complex data structures. Since the original specification is not scalable, we improve it by introducing an efficient algorithm for sending deltas of updates between replicas and by partitioning a set replica into disjunctive subsets. We further add support for limited-lifetime elements, which, in turn, enable simple garbage collection strategies to address the problem of unbounded database growth. Lastly, implementation details and evaluation results of a client library for this data structure are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Service oriented architecture (SOA) allows multiple and heterogeneous data resources to be integrated within a single service while hiding the implementation details and formats of data resources from users of the service. However, data sources for a service are often distributed geographically and connected with long-latency networks; time and bandwidth consumption of data transportation may have an impact on the system performance. Dynamic data replication is a practical solution to this problem. By replicating data copies to appropriate sites, this approach aims to reduce time and bandwidth consumptions over networks. Existing strategies for dynamic replication are typically based on so-called single-location algorithms for identifying a single site for data replication. In this paper we discuss the issues with single-location strategies in large-scale data integration applications, and examine potential multiple-location schemes. Dynamic multiple-location replication is NP-complete in nature. We therefore transform the multiple-location problem into several classical mathematical problems with different parameter settings, for which efficient approximation algorithms exist. Experimental results indicate that unlike single-location strategies our multiple-location schemes are efficient with respect to access latency and bandwidth consumption, especially when the requesters of a data set are distributed over a large scale of locations.},

  Abstract                 = {Effective data management in today’s competitive enterprise environment is an important issue. Data is information; and information is knowledge. Hence, fast and effective access to data is very important. Replication is one such widely accepted phenomenon in distributed environment, where data is stored at more than one site for performance and reliability reasons. Applications and architecture of distributed computing has changed drastically during last decade and so has replication protocols. Different replication protocols may be suitable for different applications. In this manuscript we present a survey of replication algorithms for different distributed storage and content management systems ranging from distributed Database Management Systems, Service-oriented Data Grids, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems, and Storage Area Networks. We discuss the replication algorithms of more recent architectures, Data Grids and P2P systems, in details. We briefly discuss replication in storage area network and Internet.},

Therefore,it has become common practice to engineer computing systems by taking inspirations from well-known case studies of biological systems. However, the concepts found in such systems are in many cases only partially transferable to the domain of distributed computing systems since biological systems are subject to vastly different constraints compared to those in a computing system. Our contributions in this paper are the following: (i) We present a case study of a self-organizing software system that originates from the domain of distributed computing systems. Therefore, its concepts can be exploited in other distributed computing systems much more directly, (ii) We give a detailed analysis of the emergent properties of the system and the mechanisms by which they arise, (iii) We generalize the mechanisms by which self-organization emerges in this system and present a catalog of design questions that may help engineers in creating arbitrary self-organizing systems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose the priority based adaptive data replication strategy for the reduction of the processing time in hierarchical cluster grids. Because the proposed replication strategy reflects data access patterns of users in real-time, job execution time increment due to changes in the access pattern can be reduced. We assign a Priority Value (PV) to all replicas for implementation of the replication strategy and use it for criteria of replica generation/deletion.
The PV reflects the access pattern because it is calculated from an access count and capacity of the replica. And the PV is re-calculated in real-time whenever data is requested by users. Therefore the proposed replication strategy can be reduced job execution time in data grids to recover low data availability due to changes in the access pattern.
We compare the performances of priority based adaptive data replication strategy and Popular File Replicate First (PFRF) algorithm. For this simulation, we generate 200 files sized 1GB on average and 6000 jobs, and assign these to users in each cluster. The results from simulation show that average job execution time of the proposed strategy was reduced from the no-replication by approximately 37\% and the PFRF algorithm by approximately 21\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Data replication techniques are used in data grid to reduce makespan, storage consumption, access latency and network bandwidth. Data replication enhances data availability and thereby increases the system reliability. There are two steps involved in data replication, namely, replica placement and replica selection. Replica placement involves identifying the best possible node to duplicate data based on network latency and user request. Replica selection involves selecting the best replica location to access the data for job execution in the data grid. Various replica placement and selection algorithms are available in the literature. These algorithms measure and analyze different parameters such as bandwidth consumption, access cost, scalability, execution time, storage consumption and makespan. In this paper, various replica placement and selection strategies along with their merits and demerits are discussed. This paper also analyses the performance of various strategies with respect to the parameters mentioned above. In particular, this paper focuses on the dynamic replica placement and selection strategies in the data grid environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Fast dissemination and access of information in large distributed systems, such as the Internet, has become a norm of our daily life. However, undesired long delays experienced by end-users, especially during the peak hours, continue to be a common problem. Replicating some of the objects at multiple sites is one possible solution in decreasing network traffic. The decision of what to replicate where, requires solving a constraint optimization problem which is NP-complete in general. Such problems are known to stretch the capacity of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to its limits. Nevertheless, we propose a GA to solve the problem when the read/write demands remain static and experimentally prove the superior solution quality obtained compared to an intuitive greedy method. Unfortunately, the static GA approach involves high running time and may not be useful when read/write demands continuously change, as is the case with breaking news. To tackle such case we propose a hybrid GA that takes as input the current replica distribution and computes a new one using knowledge about the network attributes and the changes occurred. Keeping in view more pragmatic scenarios in today's distributed information environments, we evaluate these algorithms with respect to the storage capacity constraint of each site as well as variations in the popularity of objects, and also examine the trade-off between running time and solution quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Creating replicas of frequently accessed objects across a read-intensive network can result in large bandwidth savings which, in turn, can lead to reduction in user response time. On the contrary, data replication in the presence of writes incurs extra cost due to multiple updates. The set of sites at which an object is replicated constitutes its replication scheme. Finding an optimal replication scheme that minimizes the amount of network traffic given read and write frequencies for various objects, is NP-complete in general. We propose two heuristics to deal with this problem for static read and write patterns. The first is a simple and fast greedy heuristic that yields good solutions when the system is predominantly read-oriented. The second is a genetic algorithm that through an efficient exploration of the solution space provides better solutions for cases where the greedy heuristic does not perform well. We also propose an extended genetic algorithm that rapidly adapts to the dynamically changing characteristics such as the frequency of reads and writes for particular objects},

  Abstract                 = {In a data grid, large quantities of data files are produced and data replication is applied to reduce data access time. Determining when and where to replicate data in order to meet performance goals in grid systems with many users and files, dynamic network and resource characteristics and changing user behavior is difficult. Therefore efficiency and fast access to replicated data are influenced by the location of the resource holding the replica. In this paper, we present an agent based replica placement algorithm to determine the candidate site for the placement of replica. An agent is deployed at each site holding the master copies of the shared data files. To create a replica, each agent prioritizes the resources in the grid based on the resource configuration, bandwidth in the network and the demand for the replica at their sites and then creates a replica at suitable resource locations. We have carried out the simulation using GridSim Toolkit-4.0 [1] for EU Data Grid Testbed1 [14]. The simulation results show that the aggregated data transfer time and the execution time for jobs at various resources is less for agent based replica placement.},

The replicas of a CRDT converge automatically, without complex concurrency control. This paper describes Treedoc, a novel CRDT design for cooperative text editing. An essential property is that the identifiers of Treedoc atoms are selected from a dense space. We discuss practical alternatives for implementing the identifier space based on an extended binary tree. We also discuss storage alternatives for data and meta-data, and mechanisms for compacting the tree. In the best case, Treedoc incurs no overhead with respect to a linear text buffer. We validate the results with traces from existing edit histories.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a new technique, adaptive replication, for automatically eliminating synchronization bottlenecks in multithreaded programs that perform atomic operations on objects. Synchronization bottlenecks occur when multiple threads attempt to concurrently update the same object. It is often possible to eliminate synchronization bottlenecks by replicating objects. Each thread can then update its own local replica without synchronization and without interacting with other threads. When the computation needs to access the original object, it combines the replicas to produce the correct values in the original object. One potential problem is that eagerly replicating all objects may lead to performance degradation and excessive memory consumption.Adaptive replication eliminates unnecessary replication by dynamically detecting contention at each object to find and replicate only those objects that would otherwise cause synchronization bottlenecks. We have implemented adaptive replication in the context of a parallelizing compiler for a subset of C++. Given an unannotated sequential program written in C++, the compiler automatically extracts the concurrency, determines when it is legal to apply adaptive replication, and generates parallel code that uses adaptive replication to efficiently eliminate synchronization bottlenecks.In addition to automatic parallelization and adaptive replication, our compiler also implements a lock coarsening transformation that increases the granularity at which the computation locks objects. The advantage is a reduction in the frequency with which the computation acquires and releases locks; the potential disadvantage is the introduction of new synchronization bottlenecks caused by increases in the sizes of the critical sections. Because the adaptive replication transformation takes place at lock acquisition sites, there is a synergistic interaction between lock coarsening and adaptive replication. Lock coarsening drives down the overhead of using adaptive replication, and adaptive replication eliminates synchronization bottlenecks associated with the overaggressive use of lock coarsening.Our experimental results show that, for our set of benchmark programs, the combination of lock coarsening and adaptive replication can eliminate synchronization bottlenecks and significantly reduce the synchronization and replication overhead as compared to versions that use none or only one of the transformations.},

  Abstract                 = {Databases have become a crucial component in modern information systems. At the same time, they have become the main bottleneck in most systems. Database replication protocols have been proposed to solve the scalability problem by scaling out in a cluster of sites. Current techniques have attained some degree of scalability, however there are two main limitations to existing approaches. Firstly, most solutions adopt a full replication model where all sites store a full copy of the database. The coordination overhead imposed by keeping all replicas consistent allows such approaches to achieve only medium scalability. Secondly, most replication protocols rely on the traditional consistency criterion, 1-copy-serializability, which limits concurrency, and thus scalability of the system. In this paper, we first analyze analytically the performance gains that can be achieved by various partial replication configurations, i.e., configurations where not all sites store all data. From there, we derive a partial replication protocol that provides 1-copy-snapshot isolation as correctness criterion. We have evaluated the protocol with TPC-W and the results show better scalability than full replication.},

  Abstract                 = {{Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation. Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types supporting both \add and \remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial CRDTs.}},

  Abstract                 = {More and more, users store their data in the cloud. While the content is then retrieved, the retrieval has to respect quality of service (QoS) constraints. In order to reduce transfer latency, data is replicated. The idea is make data close to users and to take advantage of providers home storage. However to minimize the cost of their platform, cloud providers need to limit the amount of storage usage. This is still more crucial for big contents. This problem is hard, the distribution of the popularity among the stored pieces of data is highly non-uniform: several pieces of data will never be accessed while others may be retrieved thousands of times. Thus, the trade-off between storage usage and QoS of data retrieval has to take into account the data popularity. This report presents our architecture gathering several storage domains composed of small-sized datacenters and edge devices; and it shows the importance of adapting the replication degree to data popularity. Our simulations, using realistic workloads, show that a simple cache mechanism provides a eight-fold ecrease in the number of SLA violations, requires up to 10 times less of storage capacity for replicas, and reduces aggregate bandwidth and number of flows by half.},

  Abstract                 = {Patient empowerment in the digitalized healthcare can be supported by means of telemedicine. As opposed to Electronic Patient Records developed by a few large business suppliers for healthcare professionals, telemedical applications include innovative solutions of small-medium size suppliers and are targeted at specific groups of patients (e.g., hip operated or dermatology patients) and their care network. Based on an integration experiment we argue that in order to support the national visions for patient empowerment and connectedness of healthcare at the same time, it is necessary to achieve the integration of telemedicine to the national healthcare services on a business logic (functional) integration level. In this paper, (1) we identify the lack of business logic (functional) level integration opportunities for patient oriented telemedical applications with national healthcare services; (2) we summarize on processes, products and organizations which are part of the integration procedure and provide places for shortening the time-to-market of SMBs. (3) we identify the need of supporting telemedicine uptake by extending access rights policies of the confidential patient data to decentralized citizens level access control.},

Through the improvement of ant algorithm, it can effectively choose the optimal replica node from a great number of nodes in peer-to-peer (P2P) system, which will help to realize the global optimization. The strategy fully considers that P2P nodes are heterogeneous, so the replica of a high degree of popularity will be placed in the high-performance nodes. It increases the high availability of the popular files. At the same time, owing to the increase of the high popular replica, it reduces the number of inquiring nodes when searching a file and decreasing the network traffic. This strategy also takes full consideration of the deferent factors that affect replica location, like path load, delay and so on. The simulation by using P2P tool PeerSim show that this strategy can effectively reduce request response time. Therefore, it improves performance of overall system.},

  Abstract                 = {Data replication is becoming a popular technology in many fields such as cloud storage, Data grids and P2P systems. By replicating files to other servers/nodes, we can reduce network traffic and file access time and increase data availability to react natural and man-made disasters. However, it does not mean that more replicas can always have a better system performance. Replicas indeed decrease read access time and provide better fault-tolerance, but if we consider write access, maintaining a large number of replications will result in a huge update overhead. Hence, a trade-off between read access time and write updating cost is needed. File popularity is an important factor in making decisions about data replication. To avoid data access fluctuations, historical file popularity can be used for selecting really popular files. In this research, a dynamic data replication strategy is proposed based on two ideas. The first one employs historical access records which are useful for picking up a file to replicate. The second one is a proactive deletion method, which is applied to control the replica number to reach an optimal balance between the read access time and the write update overhead. A unified cost model is used as a means to measure and compare the performance of our data replication algorithm and other existing algorithms. The results indicate that our new algorithm performs much better than those algorithms.},

The algorithm continuously moves the replication scheme towards an optimal one. We show that the algorithm can be combined with the concurrency control and recovery mechanisms of ta distributed database management system. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. On the way we provide a lower bound on the performance of any dynamic replication algorith.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the communication complexity of maintaining the replicas of a logical data-item, in a database distributed over a computer network. We propose a new method, called the minimum spanning tree write, by which a processor in the network should multicast a write of a logical data-item, to all the processors that store replicas of the items. Then we show that the minimum spanning tree write is optimal from the communication cost point of view. We also demonstate that the method by which a write is multicast to all the replicas of a data-item affects the optimal replication scheme of the item, i.e., at which processors in the network the replicas should be located. Therefore, next we consider the problem of determining an optimal replicaiton scheme for a data item, assuming that each processor employs the minimum spanning tree write at run-time. The problem for general networks is shown NP-Complete, but we provide efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal allocation scheme for three common types of network topologies. They are completely-connected, tree, and ring networks. For these topologies, efficient algorithms are also provided for the case in which reliability considerations dictate a minimum number of replicas.},
