\section{Conclusion}
We have seen databases residing in one \gls{dc}, in replicated \glspl{dc}, on mobile phones, and distributed across all with potential eventual consistency. But we have also seen how data is present at the point of entry and possible believed by the user to be persistent in a ``central'' although maybe never delivered. These scenarios represents the \glspl{crdt} at 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Server side
	\item Points-of-presence
	\item Edge of network
\end{itemize}
The attributes of the data in process
\begin{itemize}
	\item Object composition and transaction
	\item Divergence and Quality of data
	\item Security
\end{itemize}
Some of the requirements we have looked at will be supported early and can be verified in the basic programming model. Others are more comprehensive and cannot be expected to be successfully verified until later. Eventually some requirements will not be satisfied as they are not feasible in an automatic context.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic programming model
	\item Extended programming model
	\item Final programming model
\end{itemize}
All of the examples use as input to the requirement gathering are from the real world and they amongst others represent a world wide hundred billion Euro electronic entertainment industry and the Health Care Sector taking a two digit percentile of Western State Budgets. The present IT Industry have very little support for this kind of applications and as we have seen the problems addressed in the use cases are not supported in classic database implementations.
