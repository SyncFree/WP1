\section{Use Cases}
Three use cases has been identified from Rovio representing significant issues and difficulties of extreme-scale sharing and consistency within online and mobile large scale entertainment application. Further we have three distinct use cases from Trifork each representing their own application domain and each posing issues that requires \glspl{crdt}.

We are here providing an overview to illustrate the nature of the requirements we are faced with in large-scale distributed applications without global synchronisation.

The general constants and variables that applied to all the following use cases are presented in Table \ref{tab:general_definitions}.
\begin{table}[!ht]
	\begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{5.6cm}|r| }
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Name} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Description} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Type} \\
		\hline
		\hline
		$DC$ & It is the set of all \glspl{dc}. $d$ identifies one of the \glspl{dc}, $d \in DC$, where $|DC|$ is the number of \glspl{dc}. & $\mathbb{Z}_{+} $\\
		\hline
		$DV$ & It is the set of devices. $dv$ represents one of those devices, $dv \in DV$, where $|DV|$ is the number of devices. & $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ \\
		\hline
		$Nodes$ & It is the set of nodes. $n$ represents one of those nodes, $n \in Node$, where $|Nodes|$ is the number of nodes in a \gls{dc}. & $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ \\
		\hline
		$Clients$ & it is the set of clients and $c$ represents a client in the system, $c \in Clients$, where $|Clients|$ is the total number of clients. & $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ \\
		\hline
