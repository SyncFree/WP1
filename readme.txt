Suggestions
-----------

- Editors:
	* Windows:	WindEdt		http://www.winedt.com
		There use to be a free version but the full version does not cost much, less if student. I add it here because I bought it when I started my PhD and I have been using it since, arguably the best cheap LateX editor.

	* Mac:		TeXtstudio	http://texstudio.sourceforge.net
		It is free and compared with WinEdt is OK, because it is free.

- BIB:
	* JabRef
		It is free and written in Java so can be used in any OS. It is an editor to read the .bib file.

	* It is convenient and useful to have all references related to SynchFree in the same bib file as Latex will take from it only what it is used when building documents, presentations, etc.
		There is a bib file for SyncFree that should be kept update by everyone, called sybchFree.bib.

-	Glossary
	* It is advisable to keep all acronyms and definition in one '.tex' file so all documents and presentations can use them and are commonly defined.
	* There is already a glossary tex file for SyncFree that should be one directory lower than the document to be used in so everyone can use it.

For big documents it is useful to divide them in multiple files so when changing something it is easier to navigate through the file. There are many more reasons to used multiple file, like the need to resolved conflicts when different version of the same file are merged.

(Please update this file with thinks you believe they will be useful to others in the SyncFree project regarding building in Latex)
